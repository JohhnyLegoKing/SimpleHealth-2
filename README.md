# SimpleHealth 2
Still as efficient as the [original](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/15399992933/Simple-Health), but now with the added ability to edit the rate during gameplay

## Important information
- It must be a server Script so that health can be replicated to other clients
- The script's name must be "Health" (without quotes) so that it can replace the default health script
- The script's parent must be StarterCharacterScripts so that it can continue to work after the player's character dies or resets
- (If creating SimpleHealth 2 from the source on GitHub) Add the following code between line `3` and `5`:
```lua
script:SetAttribute("HealthPerSecond", 1)
```

## Benefits over the default health script
- Uses events exclusively, unlike how the default script uses an infinte while loop
- It's now possible to change the rate that a player's character heals during gameplay, by editing the script's "HealthPerSecond" attribute using a server-sided script

## Examples on how you can use the rate during gameplay
The rate's default value is `1`. This is in-order to match the same regeneration rate that the default health script uses

- Setting the rate's value to any value greater-than 0 will cause the player's character to heal faster
- Setting the rate's value to any value less-than 0 will cause the player's character to take damage
- Setting the rate to 0 will cause the character to be unable to regenerate their health
